â€¢ Prediction of CO2 Emission using Multiple Linear Regression
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset with 12 attributes and over 7K instances using ggplot2
Grouped the original categories of categorical predictors into broader categories for enhanced representation 
Implemented log transformation on the response variable and the numerical covariates to normalize the data 
Fitted a Multiple Linear Regression Model after removing multicollinearity from the data by the use of VIF 
Arrived at an R2 score of 94.47% and an Adjusted R2 score of 89.18% on the testing data
