â€¢ Prediction of CO2 Emission using Multiple Linear Regression
1.Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset with 12 attributes and over 7K instances using ggplot2
2.Grouped the original categories of categorical predictors into broader categories for enhanced representation 
3.Implemented log transformation on the response variable and the numerical covariates to normalize the data 
4.Fitted a Multiple Linear Regression Model after removing multicollinearity from the data by the use of VIF 
5.Arrived at an R2 score of 94.47% and an Adjusted R2 score of 89.18% on the testing data
